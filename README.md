# Image-Segmentation-Scilab-Project-

Abstract: Image Segmentation is a part of image analysis in 
the image processing hierarchy. The main objective is to separate 
the object of interest (foreground) from other regions 
(backgrounds). This report aimed the image processing involving 
enhancement, segmentation and morphological steps in order to 
get the best output results of the segmentation of the main object 
animal from its background. The software version involves
running the code is Scilab 6.1.1 focusing on Image Processing 
and Computer Vision toolbox (IPCV) 4.1.2 version.
Keywordsâ€” Image Segmentation, Scilab software 6.1.1,
IPCV 4.1.2
